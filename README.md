# Quantitative & Data Science Portfolio (Python & R)
This section of the repository is made up of a collection of projects produced either as part of my undergraduate degree or through self-study. It's made up primarily of iPython Notebooks, but also contains some R scripts, RMarkdown files, and other files relating to the given work (e.g. datasets, PDF files, an so on).
</br>
</br>
It's purpose is to demonstrate a well-rounded knowledge of some of the fundamental skills and abilities involved in undertaking any applied statistics/data science-related project. In the case of this portfolio, these include:

1. **Causal Inference, Machine Learning, and Other Modelling** - this section contains a number of data science projects that demonstrate proficiency in the application of a number of different causal inference methods and machine learning algorithms.
      - Regression
      - Classification
      - Clustering
      - Dimensionality reduction
      - Ensemble methods
2. **Data Visualisation and Exploratory Data Analysis** - the notebooks contained under this header are intended tod demonstrate a number of the key skills involved in most any data science project: data cleaning, wrangling, exploratory data anaylsis, and data visualisation. Each notebook will be motivated by a particular 'theme' within data visualisation, structured according to Clause Wilke's [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/).
      - Amounts and distributions
      - Proportions
      - Associations/correlations
      - Geospatial data
3.  **Maths and Statistics** - the purpose of this section is to demonstrate a working knowledge of the branches of mathematics most relevant to data science. This will primarily be done through explanatory notebooks relating to specific concepts and operations; these notebooks will provide some theoretical background, and then formalise the topic at hand through the means of Python scripts and functions.
      - Linear algebra
      - Probability theory
      - Calculus 

## Causal Inference, Machine Learning, and Other Modelling
### Regression
* [OLS Regression](https://github.com/roman-coussement/quantiative-methods-project) - using ordinary least squares regression to investigate a potential causal effect of           the legalisation of recreational cannabis in US states on traffic- and suicide-related fatalities.
### Classification
## Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualisation
### Amounts and distributions
* [House Price EDA](https://github.com/roman-coussement/roman-coussement.github.io/blob/main/house-price-eda.ipynb) - data exploration and visualisation of an extensive dataset for house price prediction.
## Maths and Statistics
### Linear Algebra
* [Matrix Multiplication](https://github.com/roman-coussement/roman-coussement.github.io/blob/main/matrix-multiplication.ipynb) - an overview of matrix multiplication alongside the construction of Python functions for carrying it out.
* [Matrix Inversion](https://github.com/roman-coussement/roman-coussement.github.io/blob/main/matrix-inversion.ipynb) - a brief discussion of matrix inversion and related topics, with accompanying Python functions.
### Calculus
* [Derivative calculator](https://github.com/roman-coussement/roman-coussement.github.io/blob/main/tangent-slope-calculator.ipynb) - a simple function to approximate the slope of a tangen, for a given function and point of evaluation, based on the formula for the limit of a derivative.

### Probability
* [Coin Toss Probability Approximation](https://github.com/roman-coussement/roman-coussement.github.io/blob/main/coin-toss-prob-approx.ipynb) - this program simulates a coin toss experiment with a large sample size, calculates the cumulative probability of a given outcome, and visualises the result over the entirety of the sample.
