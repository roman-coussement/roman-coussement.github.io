# Statistics and Data Science Portfolio
This repository is made up of a collection of projects, small and large, that I've produced either as part of my undergraduate degree, or throguh self-study. It's made up primarily of iPython Notebooks, but also contains some R scripts, RMarkdown files, and other files relating to the given work (e.g. datasets, PDF files, an so on).

It's purpose is to demonstrate a well-rounded knowledge of some of the fundamental skills and abilities involved in undertaking any applied statistics/data science-related project. In the case of this portfolio, these include:
1.  **Maths and Statistics** - The purpose of this section is to demonstrate a working knowledge of the branches of mathematics most relevant to data science. This will primarily be done through explanatory notebooks relating to specific concepts and operations; these notebooks will provide some theoretical background, and then formalise the topic at hand through the means of Python scripts and functions.
   - Linear algebra
   - Probability theory
   - Calculus 
2. **Causal Inference, Machine Learning, and Other Modelling**
   - Regression
   - Classification
   - Clustering
   - Dimensionality reduction
   - Ensemble methods
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualisation**
