For example, where $3*2=2*3$ in regular arithmetic, or $xy=yx$ in regular algebra, we can't say that - given two matrices, $A$ and $B$ - that $AB=BA$, *in all cases*.\n\nHowever, it is true in some cases. In cases in which it is true, we find that $AB=BA=I$, where $I$ is equal to the **identity matrix**: a matrix which consists of entries of 1 along the **leading diagonal** (the diagonal entries from top left to bottom right). If the above holds true, we say that $B$ is the inverse of $A$, often denoted $A^{-1}$.\n\nThe functions defined below first determine whether the matrix supplied to the function is invertible, and subsequently returns the inverted matrix.\n\n### Function to calculate the determinant of the matrix\n\nThe determinant of a matrix, denoted $det(A)$, is a scalar quantity associated with the matrix that represents the change in area/volume that results from the linear transformation associated with the matrix. For a fantastic breakdown of the intuition behind linear algebra in general, and this idea in particular (*Chapter 6 - The Determinant*), see Grant Sanderson's (3Blue1Brown) 16-part series *Essence of Linear Algebra*, available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) on YouTube.\n\nFor our purposes, our main concern is that the determinant of the matrix need be non-zero in order that our matrix has a determinant. A matrix $A$ for which $det(A)=0$ is said to be non-invertible. In the case of our $2*2$ matrix $A$, given as:\n\n$$A=\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nWe define the determinant as the difference between the two cross-multiples, or:\n\n$$det(A)=ad-bc$$\n\nThus, we make use of Python's capacity for indexing lists to define the following function:","metadata":{},"id":"7beeff98-7dcd-4913-b8a1-8f03037e106a"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def det_sqmatrix(mat):\n    \"\"\"Assumes that mat is 2x2 square matrix in the form\n    of a nested list containing two lists of length two.\n    Calculates the determinant of given matrix\"\"\"\n    det = (mat[0][0] * mat[1][1]) - (mat[0][1] * mat[1][0])\n    return det","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[],"id":"15c97d4c-27ad-4647-b748-df4a06d12677"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Function to calculate the inverse matrix\n\nThe formula for calculating the inverse matrix is given as follows:\n\n$$A^{-1}=\\frac{1}{ad-bc}\\begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\\\ -c & a \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThus, we define a function to calculate the inverse matrix. First, the function carries out the inner function, our initial function, to calculate the value of the determinant; if the determinant is equal to zero then the function returns a message to the user that the function is singular/non-invertible. Then, given a non-zero determinant, the outer function executes, using a list comprehension to return the value of the inverse matrix.","metadata":{},"id":"41da049a-fdda-425a-b16c-db884f77da60"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def invert_sqmatrix(mat):\n    \"\"\"Assumes that mat is 2x2 square matrix in the form\n    of a nested list containing two lists of length two.\n    Function checks that given matrix is invertible,\n    then calculates and returns the inverse matrix.\"\"\"\n    if det_sqmatrix(mat) == 0:\n        return \"Matrix is singular/non-invertible\"\n    else:\n        inv_mat = [[i * float((1 / det_sqmatrix(mat))) for i in ls] for\n                   ls in [[mat[1][1], -mat[0][1]], [-mat[1][0], mat[0][0]]]]\n        return inv_mat","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[],"id":"4457d98a-81b5-42b8-b4a6-86d45aa095e4"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Function verification\n\nTo verify that the function is working properly, we define a matrix $A$ as:\n\n$$A=\\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$","metadata":{},"id":"a353ecf0-9ea7-42fb-bd16-08a4f5288691"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"mat = [[4, 3],\n       [1, 1]]","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[],"id":"4d26ff01-5f87-4ffe-a9e7-ba6033606e84"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Next, we supply the matrix as an argument to the function and execute:","metadata":{},"id":"9d5066a3-442c-4296-a84f-54fa5f183feb"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(invert_sqmatrix(mat))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"[[1.0, -3.0], [-1.0, 4.0]]\n","output_type":"stream"}],"id":"3a87bde9-859d-4991-ab18-0a380e39003d"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This gives our inverse matrix as:\n\n$$A^{-1}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -3 \\\\ -1 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nFor which a verification of the maths confirms that the function is working properly.
